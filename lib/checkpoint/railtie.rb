module Checkpoint
  # Railtie to hook Checkpoint into Rails applications.
  #
  # This does three things at present:
  #
  #   1. Loads our rake tasks, so you can run checkpoint:migrate from the app.
  #   2. Pulls the Rails database information off of the ActiveRecord
  #      connection and puts it on Checkpoint::DB.config before any application
  #      initializers are run.
  #   3. Sets up the Checkpoint database connection after application
  #      initializers have run, if it has not already been done and we are not
  #      running as a Rake task. This condition is key because when we are in
  #      rails server or console, we want to initialize!, but when we are in
  #      a rake task to update the database, we have to let it connect, but
  #      not initialize.
