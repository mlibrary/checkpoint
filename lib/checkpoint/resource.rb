module Checkpoint
  # A Resource is any application object that should be considered for
  # restricted access.
  #
  # Most commonly, these will be the core domain objects that are created by
  # users ("model instances", to use Rails terminology), but this is not a
  # requirement. A Resource can represent a fixed item in the system such as
  # the administrative password, where there might be a single 'update'
  # permission to change various elements of configuration. It might also be
  # something like a section of a site as set up in a config file.
  #
  # In modeling an application, it is not always obvious whether a concept
  # should be a {Credential} or a {Resource}, so take care to evaluate the
  # options. As an example, consider access to derivatives of a high-quality
  # media object based on subscription level. It may make more sense for a
  # given application to model access to a fixed set of profiles (e.g., mobile,
  # standard, premium) as credentials and named concepts that will appear
  # throughout the codebase. For an application where the profiles are more
  # dynamic, it may make more sense to model them as resources that can be
  # listed and updated by configuration or at runtime, with a fixed set of
  # permissions (e.g., preview, stream, download).
  #
  # Checkpoint does not force this decision to be made in one way for every
  # application, but provides the concepts of permission mapping and resource
  # resolution to accommodate whatever fixed, dynamic, or inherited modeling is
  # most appropriate for the credentials and resources of an application.
