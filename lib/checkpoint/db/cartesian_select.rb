    # Helper for querying by cross-products across sets of parameters,
    # especially for grants.
    #
    # This class is called CartesianSelect because the logical search space is
    # the Cartesian product, for example, of agents X credentials X resources.
    # All permits in that space would be selected.
    #
    # This is a base class to support convenient variations for searching in
    # different scenarios. It is unlikely to be very useful in its own right,
    # but provides structure for specific subclasses. For example, {Query::ACR}
    # searches for grants when agents, credentials, and resources are all
    # known, as when checking authorization. When seeking to list agents that
    # could take a given action on a resource, {Query::CR} would be useful.
    #
    # Subclasses should extends the conditions and parameters methods to supply
    # the placeholders and matching values. The {Params} class is helpful for
    # that purpose.
    #
    # The queries are ultimately implemented with an IN clause for each key in
    # the conditions with binding expressions in the way Sequel expects them.
