module Checkpoint
  # An Agent is an any person or entity that might be granted various
  # permission, such as a user, group, or institution.
  #
  # The application objects that an agent represents may be of any type; this
  # is more of an interface or role than a base class. The important concept is
  # that permits are granted to agents, and that agents may be representative
  # of multiple concrete actors, such as any person affiliated with a given
  # institution or any member of a given group.
  #
  # In an application, agents will typically be created by the
  # {Agent::Resolver} registered with an {Checkpoint::Authority}. This keeps
  # most of the application code decoupled from the Agent type, allowing the
  # binding to happen in an isolated component. It will also generally not be
  # required to subclass Agent, since it delegates to the concrete actor in
  # flexible, well-defined ways, detailed on the individual methods here.
