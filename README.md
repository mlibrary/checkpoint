# Checkpoint

Checkpoint provides a model and infrastructure for policy-based authorization,
especially in Rails applications.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'checkpoint'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Compatibility

Checkpoint is intended to be compatible with all community-supported Ruby branches (i.e., minor versions), currently:

 - 2.6
 - 2.7
 - 3.0
 - 3.1

We prefer the newest syntax and linting rules that preserve compatibility with the oldest branch in normal maintenance.
When the security maintenance for a branch expires, Checkpoint's compatibility should be considered unsupported.

See also, [Ruby's branch maintenance policy](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/).

User documentation source is available in the `docs` directory and in rendered format
on [readthedocs](https://checkpoint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

API/class documentation is in YARD format and in rendered format on [rubydoc.info](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/checkpoint).
